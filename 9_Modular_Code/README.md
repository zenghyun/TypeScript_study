# Splitting Code Into Multiple Files 

## Namespaces & File Bundling 
- Use "namespace" code syntax to group code 
- Per-file or bundled compilation is possible ( less imports to manage )

## ES6 Imports / Exports
- Use ES6 import / export syntax 
- Per-file compilation but single <script> import 
- Bundling via third-party tools (e.g. Webpack) is possible
